### What I learned

I recently started learninng SASS and wanted to apply it to this project. I also wanted to use this project to become a little more familiar and comfortable with the BEM naming convention.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Sass Tutorial for Beginners - CSS With Superpowers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a5j7KoflTs) - I found this video incredibly helpful while learning SASS. It's a simple project, and the video may be a little old, but it really highlights some of the keys of SCSS.
- [BEM by Example](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/bem_by_example) - This article helped me understand the concept of BEM a little better.
